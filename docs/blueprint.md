## Educational Philosophy

ScholarSage is built on evidence-based learning principles:

1. **Active Recall**: Testing yourself improves retention more than passive review
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Optimal timing of reviews maximizes long-term memory
3. **Interleaving**: Mixing topics enhances learning and transfer
4. **Elaborative Interrogation**: Asking "why" deepens understanding
5. **Metacognition**: Awareness of one's learning process improves outcomes
6. **Multimodal Learning**: Combining visual, auditory, and kinesthetic inputs
7. **Adaptive Learning**: Personalization based on individual progress and needs

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #607EA3 (RGB), a muted blue suggesting focus and intelligence.
- Background color: #F4F4F8 (RGB), an off-white to ensure readability and reduce eye strain during long study sessions.
- Accent color: #A36060 (RGB), a dark rose to highlight key actions and provide a touch of warmth.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a modern, neutral look for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for navigation and interactive elements. Icons should be consistent in style and weight.
- A clean and intuitive layout will divide the screen logically into content input, analyzed content, and flashcard/quiz areas.
