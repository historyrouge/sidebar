## 🎨 Design Philosophy

ScholarSage follows these core design principles:

### 1. **Learning-First Design**
Every feature must demonstrably improve learning outcomes. Form follows educational function.

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
Don't overwhelm users. Introduce features gradually as they become relevant.

### 3. **AI as Assistant, Not Replacement**
AI augments human learning; it doesn't replace the student's effort and engagement.

### 4. **Evidence-Based Approach**
Features grounded in cognitive science and educational research (spaced repetition, active recall, etc.).

### 5. **Accessibility as Standard**
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum. Learning should be available to everyone.

### 6. **Performance Matters**
Fast load times, smooth interactions. Respect users' time and bandwidth.

### 7. **Data Privacy**
Student data is sacred. Transparent policies, minimal collection, secure storage.
